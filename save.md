# OEKS Team Tracker Video Display Issue Summary
The primary challenge we're facing in the OEKS Team Tracker application is displaying real-time video from staff computers on the admin panel. While the staff application (staff_app.py) appears to be recording videos and sending them to the admin server, the browser is unable to properly display these videos in real-time. This is manifested through errors such as "No valid video path for staff" and "AbortError: The play() request was interrupted by a new load request", indicating that there are issues with how videos are being loaded and refreshed in the browser.
Our attempts to resolve this included implementing debounce mechanisms to prevent too-frequent video refreshes, adding special handling for the latest.mp4 files, improving error handling and validation, and modifying how videos are loaded and played in the browser. We also enhanced the server's file serving capabilities with proper cache control headers and chunked video delivery. Despite these improvements, the core issue persists, suggesting there may be fundamental problems with how videos are being recorded, saved, or streamed that will require a deeper investigation into the video capture and storage process itself in our next session.
